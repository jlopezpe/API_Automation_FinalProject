# API_Automation_FinalProject

RestAssured Practice
For this practice, we will implement 4 test cases for an API in a development environment that
complies with the following tools and technologies:

● Java

● Maven

● RestAssured

● POJO

● Cucumber

The test cases should be flexible and maintainable so that they can adapt to future changes in
endpoints or test data, and they should run automatically and independently without errors. The
source code should follow coding best practices, including a README, comments, and
JavaDoc documentation where appropriate.

For this practice, we will use mockApi.io, and the base URL will be as follows:
https://63b6dfe11907f863aa04ff81.mockapi.io

TEST CASES:

1) Get the List of Clients

2) Get the List of Resources

3) Create a New Client

4) Update the Last Resource
